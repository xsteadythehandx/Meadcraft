const BEGINNER_TIPS = [
  { icon: "🧼", title: "Sanitize Everything", tip: "If it touches your mead, it needs to be sanitized. Star San is your best friend — it's no-rinse, cheap, and a little goes a long way. This is the #1 cause of failed batches." },
  { icon: "🌡️", title: "Temperature Matters", tip: "Keep your fermenting mead between 60–72°F. Too warm = fusel alcohols (harsh, hangover-inducing). Too cold = stalled fermentation. A closet usually works great." },
  { icon: "🍯", title: "Quality Honey = Quality Mead", tip: "Your mead can only be as good as your honey. Raw, local, unprocessed honey will give you the best flavor. Avoid ultra-filtered supermarket honey if you can." },
  { icon: "⏳", title: "Patience is an Ingredient", tip: "Young mead often tastes rough, hot, or weird. Give it time. Most meads need at least 2–3 months to start tasting good, and many get dramatically better at 6–12 months." },
  { icon: "🧪", title: "Feed Your Yeast", tip: "Honey is nutrient-poor. Without proper yeast nutrients (Fermaid-O or Fermaid-K), your yeast will struggle and produce off-flavors. Staggered nutrient additions are key." },
  { icon: "📏", title: "Take Gravity Readings", tip: "A hydrometer costs $8 and tells you exactly where your fermentation is. Take a reading before pitching (OG) and periodically during — it's how you know when you're done." },
  { icon: "🫧", title: "Degas During Primary", tip: "Stir or swirl your mead vigorously during the first week to release CO₂. Dissolved CO₂ stresses yeast and slows fermentation. Stop degassing after the 1/3 sugar break." },
  { icon: "🚫", title: "Don't Boil Your Honey", tip: "Old recipes say to boil honey. Don't! Boiling drives off delicate aromas and flavors. Just warm your water to dissolve the honey, or even mix it cold — the yeast doesn't care." },
  { icon: "🍶", title: "Minimize Oxygen After Primary", tip: "During primary fermentation, oxygen is fine (even helpful). After that, oxygen is your enemy — it causes stale, cardboard-like flavors. Rack gently, keep airlocks full." },
  { icon: "🧊", title: "Cold Crashing Helps Clarity", tip: "Before bottling, if you can chill your mead to near-freezing (33–38°F) for 24–48 hours, yeast and haze particles will drop out. You'll get beautiful clear mead." },
  { icon: "📝", title: "Keep Notes on Everything", tip: "Write down your recipe, OG, dates, temperatures, when you added things, and how it tastes. Future you will thank present you when you want to recreate (or avoid) a batch." },
  { icon: "🍎", title: "Add Fruit in Secondary", tip: "Adding fruit after primary fermentation preserves more fresh fruit character. Freeze fruit first to break cell walls for better extraction, and use a sanitized mesh bag for easy removal." },
  { icon: "🌿", title: "Spices: Less is More", tip: "You can always add more spice, but you can't take it out. Start with half of what you think you need, taste after a few days, and add more if desired. Especially with clove and cinnamon." },
  { icon: "🔬", title: "Stable Gravity = Done Fermenting", tip: "Take gravity readings 3 days apart. If they're the same, fermentation is complete. Don't just go by airlock activity — airlocks can bubble from temperature changes." },
  { icon: "🧴", title: "Stabilize Before Back-Sweetening", tip: "If you add honey after fermentation without stabilizing (potassium sorbate + campden tablet), the yeast will just eat the new sugar. Stabilize first, wait 24hrs, then sweeten." },
  { icon: "🫙", title: "Headspace is the Enemy", tip: "When racking to secondary, minimize the air gap above your mead. Use appropriately sized vessels, or top up with similar liquid. Excess headspace = oxidation risk." },
  { icon: "🍷", title: "Glass Over Plastic for Aging", tip: "Plastic buckets are fine for primary, but for secondary/aging, glass carboys are better — they're impermeable to oxygen and won't scratch (scratches harbor bacteria)." },
  { icon: "💰", title: "Start Small, Start Simple", tip: "Your first mead should be a simple 1-gallon traditional or cyser. Don't go crazy with 12 ingredients on batch #1. Learn the basics, then get creative." },
  { icon: "🔄", title: "Rack Off the Lees", tip: "Dead yeast (lees) on the bottom can cause off-flavors (autolysis) if left too long. Rack your mead to a clean vessel after primary, and again if more sediment builds up." },
  { icon: "🫗", title: "Use an Auto-Siphon", tip: "Trying to pour mead between vessels = disaster. An auto-siphon with tubing makes racking easy, clean, and low-oxygen. It's a $12 investment you'll use every single time." },
  { icon: "🧂", title: "Water Quality Matters", tip: "Chlorine and chloramine in tap water can create medicinal off-flavors. Use spring water, or treat tap water with a campden tablet to remove chlorine/chloramine." },
  { icon: "📦", title: "Don't Fear the Fruit Flies", tip: "Fruit flies carry acetobacter (vinegar bacteria). Keep your airlock full and your equipment covered during transfers. A single fruit fly can ruin a batch." },
  { icon: "🎯", title: "Aim for 12% on Your First Batch", tip: "Around 12% ABV is the sweet spot for beginners — it's strong enough to be interesting, but not so high that yeast stress becomes an issue. About 3.5 lbs honey per gallon." },
  { icon: "⚡", title: "Stuck Fermentation? Don't Panic", tip: "If fermentation stalls: 1) Check temperature, 2) Add nutrients if before 1/3 break, 3) Gently stir, 4) As last resort, pitch a strong yeast like EC-1118. Most stalls are fixable." },
  { icon: "🏷️", title: "Label Your Bottles", tip: "It's easy to forget what's in each bottle after a few months. Label with: name, date bottled, ABV, and any tasting notes. You'll build a library of your brewing journey." },
